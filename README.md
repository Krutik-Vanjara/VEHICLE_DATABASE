 # Information System Project

## Overview

This project aims to design, secure, optimize, and automate the management of an Information System (IS) for a used car dataset. The project involves preparing a relational schema, implementing security measures, optimizing queries, and automating tasks. The dataset contains information about used cars, which can be used for various purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.

## Dataset Details

The dataset contains the following columns:
- `name`
- `year`
- `selling_price`
- `km_driven`
- `fuel`
- `seller_type`
- `transmission`
- `Owner`

There are four different CSV files included in this dataset.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:
- `/data`: Contains the CSV files and any other data-related files.
- `/sql`: Contains SQL scripts for creating tables, queries, triggers, and procedures.
- `/docs`: Contains documentation, reports, and any other project-related documents.
- `/src`: Contains source code for any automation scripts or the graphical interface.
- `/tests`: Contains test cases and scripts for testing the database and application.

## Create Users and Roles:
   - Create the necessary users for managing your information system (e.g., administrator, manager, regular user).
   - Assign appropriate privileges to each user according to their role (e.g., read-only, modify, delete).
