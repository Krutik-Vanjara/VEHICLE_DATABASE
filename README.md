## Chapter 1
## Design the Relational Schema:
- Create a relational schema based on the data you have found, following
database modeling best practices.
- Identify the relationships between your tables (primary keys, foreign keys) and
define the integrity constraints (uniqueness, not null, etc.).
## Populating the Tables:
- Import the Excel data into your database according to the defined schema.
- Ensure that your tables are properly populated and that the relationships between
the data are consistent
